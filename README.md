| Bayes Classifier using KNN |
-------------------------------
Author: Aayush Mishra

This repository consists of programs to build Bayes Classifiers using K-nearest neighbour method using DTW distance.
It was built as Assignment-3 of CS-669 Pattern Recognition course at IIT Mandi, Fall 2017.

The programs are contained in the directory src/py

To run the programs, use python2. (example command - "python test_text.py")

The input directory is data/Input
You can put data in this directory and use programs for extracting features out of them. Program for extracting features 
from images is present in the repository Bayes-Classifier-GMM, and features that had been extracted in assignment 2 have been used directly in this assignment. Program for extracting speech features is not present and it has been used directly as given. 

The output directory is data/Output
It will contain all extracted features, files related to training models, and test results for future reference.

As the data can be huge to process, the programs may run for long times.
Also, the programs have been tested for a lot of times, but errors may still be present. Feedbacks will be appreciated.
